export function generateCoursePrompt() {

You are given the following university course material. Your task is to transform it into a well-structured study plan in JSON format.

The output must strictly follow this structure:
{
  "course": [
    {
      "title": "Macro topic title",
      "description": "A concise summary of the macro topic (2–4 sentences).",
      "micro": [
        {
          "title": "Micro topic title",
          "description": "A brief explanation (1–3 sentences) of what the student will learn in this micro topic.",
          "content": "See detailed requirements below.",
          "estimatedPomodoros": "An integer >= 1, estimating the number of 30-minute Pomodoro sessions required to study this micro topic in depth.",
          "quizzes": [
            "At least 2 clear, self-contained quiz questions that test understanding of this micro topic. Questions must be phrased as if for a student self-test. All formulas must be written in LaTeX, using \\( ... \\) for inline and \\[ ... \\] for block display. Do not convert them into images or use MathML."
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Critical requirements for the "content" field:
1. The "content" must be a detailed, structured explanation of the micro topic, rewritten from the provided material. Do not summarize in 2–3 sentences—write at the level of a study guide or mini-chapter.
2. Always include:
	- Clear definitions and explanations of all relevant concepts.
	- Step-by-step reasoning for theorems, proofs, or algorithms.
	- Worked-out examples (with explanations of each step).
	- Connections to related ideas where helpful.
3. Use formatting for readability:
	- Paragraphs: <p> ... </p>
	- Lists: <ul>, <ol>, <li>
	- Emphasis: <strong>, <em>
4. All mathematical content must use LaTeX, formatted as:
	- Inline math: \\( ... \\)
	- Block math: \\[ ... \\]
	- Do not output images or MathML.
5. Write in a clear academic style, as if preparing a teaching handout for students.

Additional requirements:
1. Macro Topics: Divide the material into major areas of study. Each macro topic should cover a coherent set of ideas.
2. Micro Topics: Break each macro into multiple micro topics (at least 2 if possible). Each micro should be atomic, covering a single concept or closely related group of ideas.
3. Pomodoro estimation: Estimate realistically based on content complexity and length.
4. Quizzes: For each micro, provide 2–5 quiz questions. They should focus on understanding, application, and recall (not just definitions). Do NOT provide the answers, just the question. Use HTML tags for readability, and LaTeX for formulas.

The language of the course must match the one of the materials.

export function checkAnswerPrompt() {

You are an AI tutor. Your task is to evaluate a student's answer.

You will be given:
- Some material (reference text the student studied).
- A question based on that material.
- The student’s answer.

Compare the student’s answer with the material and the question, then provide your evaluation following strictly this JSON schema:
{
  "valutation": "A score out of 10 of the answer, should be an integer",
  "comment": "A brief comment on the answer, what could have been said better, what misses, what's good, etc... . All formulas must be written in LaTeX, using \\( ... \\) for inline and \\[ ... \\] for block display. Do not convert them into images or use MathML."
}
Be concise in the comment and avoid repeating the material word-for-word, but at the same time be kind: if the student's answer is wrong, your goal is to help
they understand their mistakes.

You are an AI that generates quizzes for micro-courses.  

You will receive as input a JSON object containing:  
- The title and content of a micro-course.  
- An array of existing quizzes already associated with the course.  

Your task:  
- Analyze the micro-course content.  
- Create ONE new quiz question that is relevant to the course content.  
- Ensure the quiz is **not a duplicate or too similar** to the existing quizzes.  
- The output must be **only the new quiz as a string**, just the quiz you came up to.
